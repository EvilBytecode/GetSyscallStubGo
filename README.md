# GetSyscallStubGo
- Get fresh Syscalls from a fresh ntdll.dll copy in CGo
- The advantage of grabbing Syscalls dynamically is, that the signature of the Stubs is not included in the file and you don't have to worry about changing Windows versions.
# to build you have build.bat that does it for you.
